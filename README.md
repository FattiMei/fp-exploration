Testing the properties of floating point numbers from an arithmetical perspective


## Objective
On a machine that implements IEEE754 floating point arithmetic using only elementary operations (+, -, *, /, >, <, ==) deduce properties of floats like:
* number of significant digits
* exponent range
* mantissa
* exponent


## Rationale
The idea comes from applying [black-box testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing) to floating point arithmetic. Personally I want to:
* study floating point arithmetic in GPU computing
* enumerate all floating point numbers for research purpuoses
